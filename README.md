# HRSA COVID-19 HRSA Uninsured Program.

As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the HRSA has been providing support and relief to healthcare providers and emergency providers all over the US with reimbursmenets to uninsured individuals being treated for COVID-19.

In an effort to help healthcare providers in Texas (and the rest of the states), using ECW system as part of their medical suite (e.g. UT Southwestern), A very manual and tedious process is involved in claiming the individual's reimbursment. This software is designed to make that workflow easier with the use of a multi-team, organizational system for working with patient documents, patient details, lab results, and IE claims.

## HIPAA

Due to the HIPAA Act, no example documents, or example patients are used, and commits are exclusively monitored to ensure there is no violation of the HIPAA privacy laws. Due to privacy reasons, ECW demos cannot be shown due to risk of patient information exposure, and NDAs relating to lab results, state IDs, SSNs, and the Collin County COVID-19 Pandemic Program.

Residents with health insurance of any kind, or of Collin County are not eligble for the HRSA program. The HRSA CARES program is exclusively for individuals without healthcare insurance, and Collin County is reimbursing healthcare providers within Collin County for treatment or testing of individuals with, or with symptoms of COVID-19.
